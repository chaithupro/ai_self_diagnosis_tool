# ai_self_diagnosis_tool

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling early diagnosis, automating processes, and improving
patient outcomes. This project, Healthcare-AI-WebApp, focuses on utilizing machine learning and deep learning to predict
the likelihood of the following diseases: 
Lung Disease
Heart Disease
Diabetes 
Features 
Disease-Specific Pages 
Each disease has its dedicated page that includes: - Overview: A concise explanation of the disease. - Symptoms: Common
signs and indicators. - Prediction Models: Details of the AI model and required input parameters. 
Prediction Page 
The prediction page allows users to input their health metrics and receive a prediction about their likelihood of developing one
of the listed diseases. 
Libraries and Tools Used 
Flask: For backend web development.
Scikit-learn & TensorFlow: For training and deploying predictive models.
SQLAlchemy: For managing the database.
